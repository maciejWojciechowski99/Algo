              <p class="opinions__item--container--paragraph">Alicjaâ€™s classes are a masterwork. Barely had I recovered from my astonishment after the first class, when it turned out she had prepared an agenda for the whole year. Additionally, we signed a class contract and established goals. Instructional designerâ€™s dream! Each class demonstrated how perfectly prepared Alicja was. Nothing could surprise her: whether there was the whole group, one or two students, there was always a plan for the class. Activity by activity and one did not even realise the passing of an hour.
              The classes were structured in an excellent way. They were like a cake filled with Nutella on one layer and raspberry jam on another. At the beginning of each class, there was always a small talk and at the end a vocabulary set. A comment of an instructional designer: Alicja managed revisions in such a way that it was impossible not to learn. She created a wonderful vibe and at the same time was demanding. Alicja has mastered online teaching. She treats technology as work tools, not as an addition to classes.

                I have been meeting with Alicja once a week for over a year. I always wait for our English chats. I do not stress out despite not studying much for the classes. 
                I appreciate that Alicja, as a teacher, searches for a way to approach an individual student in a creative way and often surprise them. She motivates and supports me and appreciates my effort. Her teaching methods and materials are diverse. She is understanding and consistent. She is a teacher I love laughing with.
